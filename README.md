## More Learns:
Was able to use JS to loop through the DOM inorder to  add/remove classNames from HTML elements. Used functions such as:
```
document.getElementsByClassName('className');
//    This returns an array that is iterable in a forloop.


document.getElementbyId('classNamed');
//     This returns a single DOM element.


domElement.classList.add('classNameToAdd');
//    This allows you to append a className to an HTML element.


domElemet.classList.remove('classNameToRemove);
//    This allows you to remove a className from an HTML element. 

```
